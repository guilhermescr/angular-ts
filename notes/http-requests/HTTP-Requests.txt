> Requests are made in the services.
> Import these packages: HttpClient and HttpHeaders.
> Initialize the HttpClientModule in the app.module.ts -> import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
> In the imports array inside NgModule, add the HttpClientModule.
> private keyword in URLs is a good practice.
